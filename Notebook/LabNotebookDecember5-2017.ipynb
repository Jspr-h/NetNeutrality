    "\n",
    "We started our project by investigating the political debate on net neutrality. After   diving into the subject, we found that the online debate was heavily influenced by “bots”, and this somewhat distorted the perceived outcome. This became apparent, when we discovered two news articles on the subject, with conflicting takes on the debate. The FCC (the Federal Communications Commision), allowed for citizens to post comments about their stance of the net neutrality legislation. This data has afterwards been cleaned in various ways. It seems now, that how the data is processed determines the perceived outcome of the debate. One article coming from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) said the debate, in reality, was 80 pct. bot generated comments. And that 95 pct. of the organically generated comments were in favor of maintaining net neutrality. \n",

    "Background: \n",
    "In 2015, DARPA (Defense advanced research projects agency) performed the twitter bot challenge, with the goal of identifying influence-bots that supported pro vaccination discussions on twitter. 6 teams(2 universities and some private companies) competed, with Sentimetrix winning. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a description of the bot detection approaches used in the competition. It is intended to make for a definition of twitter bots, although it isn’t fully conclusive, as Bots were, and still are, hard to detect, despite research innovations within this field. \n",
    "\n",
    "A big part of the detection of bots, comes from machine learning, but the teams found that machine learning itself wasn’t sufficient. \n",

    "They also had to look at;\n",
